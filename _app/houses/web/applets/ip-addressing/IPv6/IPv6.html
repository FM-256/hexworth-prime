		<div>IP addresses are drawn from the Unallocated Address Number Pool, administered by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). On January 31, 2011, IANA allocated the last /8 IPv4 address blocks to Regional Internet Registries (RIRs). Each RIR (such as ARIN or LACNIC) allocates from its locally administered number pool. IP address ranges then make their way to Internet Service Providers (ISP). The ISP assigns the IP address to the end user.</div>

		<div>IPv6 was developed in the mid to late 90s. It is a 128-bit address space written in hexadecimal and provides 340 undecillion addresses. Compare this to IPv4 which provided 4.29 billion addresses. What happened to IPv5? Version 5 was used by the Internet Stream Protocol, an experimental streaming protocol and it was never introduced for public use.</div>

		<div>IPv6 Address Notation</div>
		<div>5/22</div>
		<div>Each 16-bit segment is separated by a colon</div>
		<div>One hex digit equals 4 bits</div>
		<div>IPv6 addresses are 128-bit addresses.</div>
		<div>There are eight 16-bit segments that range between 0000 and FFFF</div>
		<div>6/22</div>
		<div>For the IP address below, apply Rule 1 and enter your answer in the blank box (the first two 16-bit segments have been done as an example).</div>
		<div>Correct!</div>

</div>
		<div>2001</div>
		<div>Try Again!</div>
		<div>To simplify the entry of IPv6 addresses, the address can be shortened. The maximum reduction of an IPv6 address is known as the compressed format. There are several rules for compressing IPv6 addresses. Rule 1 is that any leading zeroes in any 16-bit segment do not have to be written.</div>
		<div> 
</div>
		<div>db8</div>
		<div>Hint: Any leading zeroes do not have to be written

		<div>Rule 2</div>
		<div>7/22</div>
		<div>COMPRESS</div>
		<div>The second rule is that any single, contiguous string of one or more 16-bit segments that are all zeroes can be represented with a double colon (::).</div>
		<div>Rule 1</div>
		<div>IPv6 Rule 2</div>
		<div>For the IP address below enter your answer in the blank box.
(Note: Please don’t use any blank spaces in your answer).</div>
		<div>9/22</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Compressed Address 1</div>
		<div>Hint: The longest string of zeroes must be replaced by ::

</div>
		<div>Click the COMPRESS button to see the compressed format of the IP addresses.</div>
		<div>IPv6 Rule 3</div>
		<div>8/22</div>
		<div>If an IP address contains more than one string of contiguous all-zero segments, the longest string of zeroes must be replaced by the :: and if they are equal, the first string of zeroes uses the :: representation.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Compressed Address 2</div>
		<div>Hint: if the strings of zeroes are equal, the first string of zeroes uses the :: representation

		<div>Compressed Address 3</div>
		<div>Anycast</div>
		<div>12/22</div>
		<div>Multicast</div>
		<div>Assigned to more than one interface (typically different devices). When a packet is sent to an anycast address, it is delivered to the closest interface. Anycast addresses can only be used by a device (not a host), and it cannot be used as the source address of an IPv6 packet.</div>
		<div>Click each type of address for more information.</div>
		<div>Used by multiple hosts (handles the functionality of an IPv4 broadcast address) and always begins with FF. A device sends a single packet to multiple destinations simultaneously.</div>
		<div>Unicast</div>
		<div>Types of Addresses</div>
		<div>Identifies a single node on a network. Unicast addresses include Global Unicast (globally routable), Link-Local (not routable), Loopback and Unique Local addresses (private addresses). A unicast address sends a single packet to a single destination.</div>

</div>
		<div>The interface ID part of the address can be created several different ways by:Using the interface’s MAC addressObtaining one automatically from a DHCPv6 serverRandom assignmentManual configuration</div>
		<div>Unicast and anycast addresses have the same structure. The first four fields (64 bits) refer to the network and subnetwork. The last four fields are the interface ID (think host portion of an IPv4 address).</div>
		<div>Typically, the first 56 bits within the address are the routing, or global, prefix. The next 8 bits are the subnet ID .</div>

		<div>Address Range</div>
		<div>An IPv6 address range will be made up of the following:Prefix – equivalent to the network address of an IPv4 address; made up of the global routing prefix and subnet IDPrefix length – a decimal value indicating the number of leftmost contiguous bits of the address that identifies the network portion of the address (equivalent to the subnet mask in IPv4). When used with a unicast address, it separates the prefix portion of the address from the Interface ID.Interface ID – equivalent to the host portion of an IPv4 address</div>

		<div>0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1</div>
		<div>The link-local unicast range (FE80::10 to FEBF::/10) is not routable off the link. An IPv6 device must have at least a link-local (local to the network) address to communicate to the IPv6 network before it has a GUA. The router’s link-local address is used by hosts as the default gateway address.</div>
		<div>The host is not configured and is equivalent to 0.0.0.0 in IPv4 (equals ::)</div>
		<div>Global unicast addresses (GUAs) are routable and are equivalent to public IPv4 addresses. The valid range for GUAs are from 2000::/64 thru 3fff:fff:fff:fff::/64.

A unique local address (ULA) in the range FC00::/7 is equivalent to IPv4 private network addressing.

The link-local unicast range (FE80::10 to FEBF::/10) is not routable off the link. An IPv6 device must have at least a link-local address to communicate to the IPv6 network before it has a GUA. The router’s link-local address is used by hosts as the default gateway address.</div>
