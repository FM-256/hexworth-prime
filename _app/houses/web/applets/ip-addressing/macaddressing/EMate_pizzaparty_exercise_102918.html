		<div>Understanding the Use of MAC Addressing Within a Network and IP Addressing Outside of a Network</div>
		<div>You are having some friends over your house and you are ordering pizza for everyone. So you gather everyone’s name and their orders and write them down on a piece of paper.</div>

		<div>Understanding the Use of
MAC Addressing within a Network and IP Addressing Outside of a Network</div>
		<div>This material was developed with funding from the
National Science Foundation under Grant # DUE 1601612
</div>
		<div>Changes if you move to a new network</div>
		<div>Does not change – “burned” into computer</div>

		<div>1 Pepperoni for Kate
1 Cheese for Molly & Jane
1 Veggie for Jose
1 Veggie for John
</div>
		<div>3/17</div>
		<div>When you call to order a pizza you give the restaurant the order for the entire house rolling up all the orders into one. Your request for pizza leaves your home when you make the phone call and is passed to the restaurant.</div>
		<div>1 Pepperoni 
1 Cheese
2 Veggie

</div>
		<div>This is similar to the time when you used your computer to access Google while your friend was also using the local area network (LAN) to try to access a different website.</div>

		<div>Website homepage request for 34-E7-D4-81-B5-F2

Website homepage request for 54-E3-D2-65-A1-E2</div>
		<div>Local Area Network (LAN)

a collection of computers, and other devices that share a common network connection and exist in a limited geographic area, usually within a building.</div>
		<div>Wide Area Network (WAN)

a collection of computers, and other devices that share a common network connection and exist in a large geographic area, and generally connects multiple local area networks (LANs).</div>
		<div>Your router gathers these requests and sends them out across the Internet to their intended locations. The request for the website homepages leaves your local area network (LAN) when the router passes the information through the wide area network (WAN) of other Internet routers and ultimately to the websites’ web servers.</div>
		<div>Router

a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.</div>
		<div>5/17</div>
		<div>Internet</div>
		<div>You give the pizza restaurant your home address (street number, street, and city) to deliver the pizza to. This is the same as providing to the websites web servers the public IP address of the default gateway to your network to deliver the website homepages to.</div>
		<div>Default Gateway

an access point or router that a computer on the same network uses to send information to a computer on another network or the internet.</div>
		<div>Public IP Address:
172.31.255.255
</div>
		<div>6/17</div>
		<div>Internet Protocol (IP) Address

is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet or a local network.</div>
		<div>Address:
525 Main Street Boston, MA</div>
		<div>The delivery man is required to deliver to the door of your home using the home address. The pizza delivery man isn’t interested in who will get the pizza or how you will divide up the pizza once he has completed his task of bringing it to the home address.</div>
		<div>7/17</div>
		<div>Public IP Address:
172.31.255.255
</div>
		<div>8/17</div>
		<div>The pizza delivery person just needs your address to deliver the pizza. Similarly, the routers along the way just need the public IP address of the default gateway. The routers are not interested in who will get the web address request once it is brought to the default gateway IP address.</div>
		<div>Once the pizza is inside your home, you will divide up the pizzas and give them to the people within the home. But how do you deliver them to the right person? Each person has a unique identifier, usually use their name. You check your order and use their name to get the pizza to the right person.</div>
