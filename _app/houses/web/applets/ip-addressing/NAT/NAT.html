		<div>Network Address Translation/
Port Address Translation
</div>
		<div>IPv4 is a 32-bit address space that supports a total of four billion addresses worldwide. With the proliferation of devices that can connect to the Internet, there was a growing need to exceed the 4-billion address capacity. In 2002, the Internet Engineering Task Force (EITF) proposed a solution—network address translation (NAT).

		<div>NAT uses two types of IPv4 addresses: public and private. To create private IP addresses, the IETF proposed the implementation of RFC 2663 establishing three PRIVATE pools of IPv4 addresses. These private IP addresses are only used inside a private network such as a home or office since they are not allowed on the Internet. This means that private IP addresses can be reused by any private network whereas a public IP address can be used only once.</div>
		<div><<click to reveal</div>
		<div>All devices on the Internet must use a public IP address that falls into the traditional Class A, B, or C range.

		<div>Isaac only has one Internet connection and one public IP address assigned by his ISP. NAT allows devices with a private IP address to communicate outside the private network. Multiple devices can access the same Internet connection at the same time.

		<div>Default Gateway Address
192.168.0.1</div>
		<div>When the device needs access to a network, it sends a request to the router. The router converts the private address to the public one. The private network has only one public address assigned by the ISP, so the router also adds a unique port number and saves this information to its NAT forwarding table.

		<div>Private IP Addresses are:</div>
		<div>Not routable
</div>
		<div>Each device within Isaac’s private network recieves a private IP address, and the devices can communicate with each other using these addresses. But what happens when one of these devices needs to communicate outside the private network? Remember, private IP addresses are not pemitted on the Internet.</div>

		<div>Isaac has a home network with a wireless router. His Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides a public IP address for the router’s outside interface.Isaac is responsible for configuring his home network. First he assigns the router (the default gateway) a private address to its inside interface. Next he creates an IP address pool with a range of addresses that the router uses to automatically assign a private address to each device that requests one. Finally, he enables NAT on his router.

		<div>When multiple requests come from one device, which content needs to be displayed on which page? NAT was enough to handle a single request, but what about multiple requests? Enter Port Address Translation (PAT). With PAT, the port is also noted. The tablet has only one IP address with multiple browsing sessions. The router tracks which packets are for each request.
