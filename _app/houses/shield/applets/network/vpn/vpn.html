		<div>VPN Connection</div>
		<div>Internet</div>
		<div>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure and encrypted connection over a public network (like the Internet) and hides your information from others who may try to snoop or track your online behavior. A VPN is like a private tunnel that safeguards your online activities and keeps sensitive data secure. </div>

		<div>Quick Summary…
Remote access VPNs (also called client-based VPNs or client-to-server VPNs) provide remote access to a private network.Site-to-Site VPNs enable organizations to combine their networks from different locations into a single network, or intranet.Mobile VPNs allow a connection to a local network.Personal VPN services provide encrypted access to a third-party server.

		<div>IP Address Masking: When connected to a VPN, your IP address appears as that of the VPN server you are connected to. This helps to maintain anonymity online.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Bypass Geo-Restrictions: Since a VPN can make it appear as if you are browsing from a different location, you can access content that may be restricted in your actual location.</div>
		<div>Secure Public Wi-Fi: Using a VPN when connected to public Wi-Fi ensures that your data is safe from potential hackers.</div>
		<div>Remote Access: VPNs allow users to access a private nework remotely which is useful for businesses with employees working from different locations.</div>
		<div>VPN Functions</div>
		<div>click on each highlighted icon</div>
		<div>Encryption: Ensure that the data being sent and received is only readable by the intended recipient. Even if someone interecepted the data, it would appear as gibberish without the appropriate decryption key.</div>
		<div>Tunneling: A VPN creates a “tunnel” between the user and the destination server to ensure that data is securely transmitted from one end to the other.</div>

		<div>The VPN client software on Fiona’s device decrypts the data so she can actually understand and use it.</div>
		<div>The VPN server checks that Fiona is allowed network access. Once Fiona authenticates, the client software on Fiona’s computer and the server establish an encrypted tunnel. Fiona's data travels through the encrypted tunnel to the VPN server.</div>

</div>
		<div>The data wrapped in the encrypted tunnel from Fiona's computer is decrypted by the virtual private network server.</div>
		<div>click on each number as it appears</div>
		<div>Fiona's data is then sent from the VPN server to the Intenet and receives a reply based on her query.</div>

		<div>Remote Access VPNs</div>
		<div>Site-to-Site VPNs</div>
		<div>There also needs to be a VPN server on the network end of the connection.</div>
		<div>Mary can use the VPN to access the company’s network when she works from home. Her computer works as if it were connected to the company network, AND the data she is working with is protected as it goes through the public Internet.</div>
		<div>To use a remote access VPN, install client software or configure the device's operating system to connect to the VPN.</div>
		<div>VPNs use protocols, the set of rules that describe how to create a secure connection between the device and the VPN server. They are also know as tunneling protocols, because they form the VPN tunnel that hides Mary and Adam's web activity from Internet snoopers.</div>
		<div>Click the cloud to continue</div>
		<div>Adam, a business traveler can connect to the company’s network from the Wi-Fi in the hotel loby and access all the same files and software as if he were in the office. The VPN also protects Adam’s data from anyone snooping on the hotel’s public Wi-Fi.</div>
		<div>A Site-to-Site VPN (also known as a network-based VPN) joins together two networks on different sites. When the networks being connected belong to one company, the combined VPN is known as an intranet-based VPN and enables the company to establish a wide area network (WAN). 

When the networks being connected belong to different companies, the combined VPN is known as an extranet-based VPN and enables the company to connect to its supplier’s network to operate more efficiently.
</div>
		<div>Site 1’s private network</div>
		<div>Site 2’s private network</div>
		<div>A router at each site are connected. IPsec (the VPN protocol) creates the tunnel. A router-based tunnel allows any traffic between the network through. A policy-based tunnel sets up rules to determine what traffic is allowed through, and which IP network can talk to other IP networks.</div>
		<div>A mobile VPN is a better option than a remote VPN if the user is unlikely to have a stable connection on the same network for the entire session. The mobile VPN connection persists even if the user switches Wi-Fi or cellular networks, loses connectivity, or switches the device off for awhile. This VPN can be used with any device and any connection (it does not have to be a mobile phone on a mobile network). 
</div>
		<div>Connect to a server in the VPN provider’s network
</div>
		<div>click on Adam to continue</div>
		<div>The personal VPN encrypts Adam's connection, hides his identity online, and lets him spoof his geographic location. A personal VPN service differs from a remote access VPN by giving Adam access to the public Internet rather than a private network.
