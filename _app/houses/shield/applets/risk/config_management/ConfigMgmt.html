		<div>When you purchase a system, the manufacturer’s default settings are rarely the most secure. Each system and component needs to be configured to achieve a secure state or baseline configuration.

Configuration management is the process of identifying, controlling, accounting for, and auditing any changes made to that established baseline.

		<div>Ivan oversees the operating systems for the company. Once he establishes a baseline, he can configure similar systems with the same baseline to achieve the same level and depth of security.

		<div>I established the

		<div>Click here to turn off unnecessary ports</div>
		<div>Systems provide a wide variety of functions and services. Determine which functions and services the company requires and disable unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized access.

		<div>Principle of Least Functionality</div>
		<div>5/10</div>
		<div>Configuration management includes controlling who can chage system configurations. An organization’s security policies specify who can install software on its systems.  Permitted software includes updates and security patches to existing software applications from approved sources. Prohibited software includes software that an organization considers potentially malicious. System or security administrators are commonly the only ones allowed to install additional applications on a system.
</div>
		<div>Only users with
Administrative
privileges can 
install software.

Settings
</div>
		<div>Configuration settings are the parameters that you can change to affect the security or the functionality of hardware, software, or firmware components on servers, workstations, scanners, printers, firewalls, routers, wireless access points, operating systems, and applications.

The security parameters set up (registry settings; account, file, or directory settings; and settings for ports, protocols, and remote connections) create a secure configuration, or system lockdown. Any unapproved changes get blocked.

		<div>Track, review, and approve changes to any computing environment before rolling changes out to production systems. To accomplish this, the organization has the management and technical team leads join the monthly meeting to address change controls.

During the meeting, everyone reviews all proposed changes to discuss potential impacts to the system and to the physical environment before the organization implements the changes.

		<div>George needs to add an additional network storage appliance to the organization’s server farm. all of the servers are in a data center with locked doors.

To gain access to the data center, George requests a key card to enter the data center to modify the hardware configuration. The center manager arranges for the change during scheduled downtime and records the changes made and the time.

		<div>Whitelisting</div>
		<div>Maintain proper software inventory</div>
		<div>Black and white lists determine what applications and software get installed as well as websites that the user can visit.

To implement whitelisting, the organization must establish a “normal” environment and then have control over it.
