		<div>An organization’s process of identifying and assessing risk is a continuous effort due to changing threats. The goal of risk management is to reduce these threats to an acceptable level.</div>
		<div>Acceptable Risk</div>
		<div>What is Risk Management?</div>
		<div>2/7</div>
		<div>High Risk</div>
		<div>Lower Risk</div>
		<div>Risk Management Terminology</div>
		<div>3/7</div>
		<div>Introduction</div>
		<div>Risk analysis is a technique used to identify and assess factors that may threaten Information and Information systems. The study of Risk Analysis includes several commonly used terms.</div>
		<div>Threat</div>
		<div>Security Control</div>
		<div>Vulnerability</div>
		<div>Asset</div>
		<div>Risk</div>
		<div>Risk Assessment</div>
		<div>Threat Agent</div>
		<div>Exposure</div>
		<div>Countermeasure</div>
		<div>Impact</div>
		<div>Anything of value that is used in and is necessary to the completion of a business task. Assets include both tangible and intangible items such as equipment, software code, data, facilities, personnel, market value and public opinion.

Click each asset type below.
</div>
		<div>Intangible</div>
		<div>Tangible</div>
		<div>Unintentional</div>
		<div>A malicious act or unexpected event that damages information systems or other related organizational assets.</div>
		<div>Intentional</div>
		<div>Unexpected Event</div>
		<div>How dare you!</div>
		<div>An individual or group that acts, or has the power to, exploit a vulnerability or conduct other damaging activities.</div>
		<div>Any flaw or weakness that would allow a threat to cause harm and damage an asset.</div>
		<div>You Won!</div>
		<div>Error!
Website unavailable
</div>
		<div>The probability of loss due to a threat to an organization’s assets.</div>
		<div>An action, device, procedure, or technique that reduces a threat or a vulnerability by eliminating or preventing it.</div>
		<div>Multi Step Authentication
Enter 4 digit PIN</div>
		<div>Your account has been locked</div>
		<div>Technical and physical measure or administrative policies and procedures designed to implement specific security functionality taken to avoid, detect, offset, or minimize security threats to an organization's assets. Information security control functions are preventative, detective, deterrent, compensating, recovery or corrective.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>ADWARE AND SPYWARE
Adware is software designed to track browsing habits. Advertisements and pop-ups appear based on the tracked habits. Spyware is installed on a computer without the user’s knowledge and can contain keyloggers that record personal information including email addresses, passwords, and even credit card numbers.</div>
		<div>PASSWORD CRACKING
Various measures used to discover computer passwords by recovering passwords from data stored in, or transported from, a computer system. Cracking is done by either repeatedly guessing the password by using a computer algorithm where numerous combinations are tried until the password is successfully discovered or by using a dictionary-type list.</div>
		<div>4/7</div>
		<div>MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACK
The attacker eavesdrops on a communication between two targets. This type of attack gains access by stealing credentials or by altering transmitted data.</div>
		<div>ROGUE SECURITY SOFTWARE
Software that misleads users into believing that there is a computer virus installed on their computer or that their security measures are not up-to-date. An offer of installing or updating security settings leads to the installation of malware.</div>
		<div>UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO SENSITIVE DATA BREACH
Information is stolen or taken from a system without the knowledge or authorization of the system’s owner. Stolen data may involve sensitive, proprietary, or confidential information such as credit card numbers, customer data, trade secrets, or matters of national security.</div>
		<div>VIRUS
Software that can be spread from one computer to another. Viruses require a host to spread and are often sent as email attachments or downloaded from the web with the intent to infect a computer (and other computers on your contact list) by using systems on your network.</div>
		<div>IDENTY THEFT
Someone wrongfully obtains and uses another person's personal data in a way that involves fraud or deception, typically for economic gain.</div>
		<div>Identifying Threats</div>
		<div>MALWARE
MALicious softWARE is developed by cyber attackers with the intention of gaining access or causing damage to a computer or network, often while the victim remains oblivious to the fact that there has been a compromise.</div>
		<div>LOGIC BOMB
Code inserted into an operating system or software application that triggers a malicious function based on a specific condition (the date, a user account being deleted).</div>
		<div>SERVICE DISRUPTIONS
An interruption of information or information systems due to electrical or other related issues.</div>
		<div>ROOTKITS
A collection of software tools that enables remote control and administration-level access over a computer or computer network. Once remote access is obtained, the rootkit can perform malicious actions such as installing a keylogger, stealing passwords or disabling antivirus.</div>
		<div>WORMS
Standalone malicious programs that self-replicates quickly and spread from one computer to another. A worm does not require a host and can spread from an infected computer via a network without human intervention.</div>
		<div>RANSOMWARE
Holds a victim's data hostage on the computer through robust encryption. There is then a demand made for payment (usually in the form of Bitcoin, an untraceable digital currency) in order to release control of the captured data.</div>
		<div>EQUIPMENT FAILURE
Prevents users from accessing needed data and system resources.</div>
		<div>PHISHING
A method of social engineering to obtain sensitive data such as passwords, usernames, credit card numbers. The attacks often come in the form of instant messages or emails designed to look like they come from a legitimate source.</div>
		<div>In today’s information driven world, data and protecting data systems are critical considerations for businesses. Customers want to ensure that their information is secure, and businesses face multiple threats in protecting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive and private information.</div>
		<div>DoS AND DDoS ATTACKS
A DoS attack uses an infected host to flood a system with requests making it impossible for legitimate users to access the flooded resource. Distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS) uses multiple infected hosts (or an army of zombies) across the Internet to bring down a site.</div>

		<div>Risk Management Process</div>
		<div>Negligence means that no actions or controls are taken to lower risk. The threat is very high, and the cost of an incident could be catastrophic.</div>

		<div>Accounts Receivable</div>
		<div>Click each step of the risk management process for more information.</div>
		<div>Risk management is a formal process that reduces the impact of threats and vulnerabilities. You cannot eliminate risk completely, but you can manage risk to an acceptable level. Risk management measures the impact of a threat and the cost to implement controls or countermeasures to mitigate the threat. All organizations accept some risk. The cost of a countermeasure should not be more than the value of the asset you are protecting.</div>
		<div>Identify the threats throughout the organization that increase risk. Threats identified include processes, products, attacks, potential failure or disruption of services, negative perception of organization’s reputation, potential legal liability, or loss of intellectual property.</div>

		<div>Bathrooms Flood = $50,000 (Very Low)</div>
		<div>Qualitative
Risk</div>
		<div>VULNERABLITIES</div>
		<div>Once a risk has been identified it is assessed and analyzed to determine the severity the threat poses. Some threats that can bring the entire organization to a standstill while other threats are merely minor inconveniences. Risk can be prioritized by actual financial impact (Quantitative Analysis) or a scaled impact on the organization's operation (Qualitative Analysis).</div>

		<div>Purchase insurance = $750</div>
		<div>Bathroom Flood = $50,000</div>
		<div>This step involves developing an action plan to reduce overall organization risk exposure. Management ranks and prioritizes threats; a team then determines how to respond to each threat. Risk can be eliminated, mitigated, transferred, or accepted.</div>
		<div>Laptop checkout policy/harddrive encryption = $150</div>
		<div>Continuously reviewed for both risk reductions due to elimination, mitigation, or transfer actions. Not all risks can be eliminated so threats that are accepted need to be closely monitored. It is important to understand that some risk is always present and acceptable.</div>
		<div>Bathrooms Flood = $50,000</div>
		<div>$10,000</div>
		<div>Due care involves taking reasonable steps to lower the level of risk. The risk still exists but reasonable steps lower a potential loss.</div>
		<div>Due diligence involves responsible steps taken to eliminate risk. Some risks still exist, but multiple controls are implemented to prevent potential loss.</div>
		<div>Stolen laptop = (Very high)</div>
		<div>Server Failure = (Medium)</div>
		<div>Bathroom Flood = (Very Low)</div>
