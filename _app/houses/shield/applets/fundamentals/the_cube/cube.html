</div>
		<div>Security Measures</div>
		<div>The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 used to establish and evaluate information security programs. This security model has three dimensions and looks like a Rubik’s cube.</div>
		<div>2/5</div>
		<div>Information States</div>
		<div>Prevents the disclosure of sensitive information from unauthorized people, resources, and processes</div>
		<div>Integrity</div>
		<div>3/5</div>
		<div>Protects system information or processes from intentional or accidental modification</div>
		<div>Availability</div>
		<div>Information Security Properties</div>
		<div>Click on each security principle</div>
		<div>Confidentiality</div>
		<div>The first dimension of the cube identifies the goals to protect information systems and are the foundational principles. These three principles are referred to as the CIA Triad.</div>
		<div>Assures that authorized users can access systems and data when and where needed and limits those that do not meet established conditions</div>
		<div>The second dimension of the cube focuses on protecting data in each of its possible states.</div>
		<div>Click on each information state</div>
		<div>4/5</div>
		<div>Transmission</div>
		<div>Data traveling between information systems (data in transit)</div>
		<div>Data stored in memory or on permanent storage such as a hard drive, solid-state drive, or USB drive (data at rest)</div>
		<div>Processing</div>
		<div>Storage</div>
		<div>Data being used in performing an operation such as updating a database record (data in process)</div>
		<div>Administrative controls that provide a foundation for how an organization implements information assurance and include establishing policies, procedures and guidelines to follow good practices</div>
		<div>Software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems including VPNs, IDS, and firewalls</div>
