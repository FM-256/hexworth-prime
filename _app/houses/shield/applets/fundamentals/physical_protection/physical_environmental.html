		<div>Physical and Environmental Protection Controls</div>
		<div>Physical Access Control

An organization determines the types of facility guards needed including security staff, administrative staff, or information system users.

Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems in secured areas.</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Delivery and Removal

The organization authorizes, monitors, and controls both entering and exiting the facility and maintains records of those items.</div>
		<div>Physical Access Control

The organization uses lockable physical casings to protect information system components from unauthorized physical access.

The organization employs a penetration testing process that includes unannounced attempts to bypass or circumvent security controls associated with physical access points to the facility.</div>
		<div>Physical Access Authorizations

Access to secure areas of the building require a control that identifies access authority for an individual. Badges prevent unauthorized users from roaming freely throughout the facility.</div>
		<div>Information Leakage

The organization protects the information system from information leakage due to electromagnetic signals emanations. Information leakage is the intentional or unintentional release of information to an untrusted environment from electromagnetic signals emanations.</div>
		<div>Water Damage Protection

The organization protects the information system from damage resulting from water leakage by providing master shutoff or isolation valves that are accessible, working properly, and known to key personnel.</div>
		<div>Physical Access Control

Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.

Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred (procedural), automated by capturing ID provided by a personal identity verification card, or some combination.</div>
		<div>Access Control for Transmission Medium

Security safeguards to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include locked wiring closets, disconnected or locked spare jacks, and protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays.</div>
		<div>Location of Information System Components

Physical and environmental hazards include flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, and electrical interference. In addition, an organization needs to consider the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals might have an increased chance for unauthorized access to secure areas.</div>
		<div>Access Control for Output Devices

Controlling physical access to output devices includes placing these devices in locked rooms or other secured areas. You can only allow access to authorized individuals or place output devices in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Monitors, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of information system output devices.</div>
		<div>SECURE AREAS</div>
		<div>2/15</div>
		<div>Asset Monitoring and Tracking

The organization tracks and monitors the location and movement of assets within controlled areas and ensures that asset location technologies are employed in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.</div>
		<div>Power Equipment and Cabling

The organization protects power equipment and power cabling for the information system from damage and destruction (generators and power cabling outside of buildings, internal cabling, and uninterruptable power sources).</div>
		<div>PERIMETER</div>
		<div>Visitor Access Records

The organization maintains and reviews visitor access records to the facility where the information system resides. The reception area is where visitors sign-in and get an escort before entering controlled areas of the building.</div>
		<div>BUILDING ACCESS</div>
		<div>Monitoring Physical Access

The organization monitors suspicious physical access activities (access outside of normal work hours, repeated entry to areas not normally accessed or for unusual lengths of time, and out-of-sequence accesses to the facility where the information system resides. Monitoring physical access includes detecting and responding to physical security incidents, reviewing physical access logs, and coordinating the results of reviews and investigations with the organizational incident response capability.</div>
		<div>Physical and environmental security includes measures taken to protect systems, buildings and the supporting infrastructure against threats associated with their physical environment.

</div>
		<div>Emergency Power

The organization provides a short-term uninterruptible power supply to facilitate an orderly shutdown of the information system or transition of the information system to long-term alternate power in the event of a primary power source loss.</div>
		<div>Emergency Shutoff

The organization provides the capability of shutting off power to the information system or individual system components in emergency situations by having emergency shutoff switches or devices to facilitate safe and easy access for personnel and by protecting emergency power shutoff capability from unauthorized activation.</div>
		<div>Fire Protection

The organization employs and maintains fire suppression and detection devices/systems (sprinkler systems, handheld fire extinguishers, fixed fire hoses, smoke detectors) for the information systems that are supported by an independent energy source in data centers, server rooms and mainframe computer rooms.</div>
		<div>Temperature and Humidity Controls

The organization maintains and monitors temperature and humidity levels within the facility where the information system resides.</div>
		<div>Physical Access Authorizations

When a visitor arrives, an organization may require two forms of identification for access to the facility (Visitor presents a driver’s license and his fingerprint).

An organization may require any visitor to the facility be escorted while in the building.</div>
		<div>Emergency Lighting

The organization employs and maintains automatic emergency lighting for the information system that activates in the event of a power outage or disruption and that covers emergency exits and evacuation routes within the facility.</div>
		<div>Physical Access Control

The organization employs guards and/or alarms to monitor every physical access point to the facility where the information system resides 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.</div>
		<div>Policy and Procedures

It is the responsibility of upper management to determine the policies and procedures that an organization should implement to physically protect its assets. These policies and procedures reflect federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance and can be included as part of the general information security policy.</div>
		<div>Alternate Work Site

An organization has alternate work sites such as remote facilities or employee residences that provides readily available alternate locations as part of contingency operations.</div>
