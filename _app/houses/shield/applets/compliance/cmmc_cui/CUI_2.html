		<div>Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) is the compliance risk management topic that every defense industry and research institution should be discussing. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities and regulatory compliance requirements are two very challenging areas for most organizations.

CUI compliance stakeholders span the organization from users that generate CUI data to the Board of Directors responsible for the organization’s due diligence for safeguarding these assets.

		<div>Controlled Unclassified Information is information the government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using safeguarding or dissemination controls.

		<div>Click to enlarge</div>
		<div>FOUO is a government generated protective marking.  For Official Use Only (FOUO) is a document designation, not a classification. This designation is used by the Department of Defense and several other federal agencies to identify information or material which, although unclassified, may not be appropriate for public release. The contractor is responsible for handling and protection of FOUO markings only when generated and disseminated by the Government and is required to apply FOUO markings only when extracting FOUO information from such material.</div>

		<div>Electronic Storage Media Marking</div>
		<div> The SF 903 USB drive size label is about 2.125” x .625”. Place the SF903 to a USB drive containing CUI in a manner that does not adversely affect the operation of the drive or the operation of the medium in which you insert it. Once you apply the label, it cannot be removed.</div>

		<div>9/11
</div>
		<div>There are only a few differences between the rules for marking printed documents and email. A Banner Marking will be placed at the top of the email body and the email must carry a CUI Designation Indicator. If you forward an email that contains CUI, you must include all the original CUI markings.

NARA also recommends that sends terminate the Suject Line with the phrase [Contains CUI]. If the email includes an attachment that contains CUI, NARA also recommends that the file name indicate the presence of CUI, such as FileName[CONTAINS CUI}.docx.
</div>
		<div>Email CUI Markings</div>
		<div>All documents containing CUI must indicate the designator's agency.The designation indicator can be accomplished using a letterhead, a signature block that includes the agency, or a "Controlled by" line. The CUI Designation Indicator is required. It may also contain optional contact information.

Document Markings

		<div>Agencies may choose to require documents to include portion markings.placed at the beginning of a section (such as at the start of a paragraph)provide granularity to identify what specific information belongs to specific CUI Categories or has specific Limited Dissemination Controls</div>

If the document contains CUI Specified, the CUI Category marking must start with “SP-“ and list the specified category. A CUI Category can have both CUI Basic and CUI Specific. It is the authority, not the information, that makes it CUI Basic or CUI Specific so you must know under which authority you designate a document as CUI.</div>

		<div>If you are unable to access internal computer storage media, you must mark the outside of the computer. If you are using government-owned equipment, you can use an SF 902 or SF 903 to mark equipment. The SF 902 and 903 are nearly identical except the SF903 is narrow. If you are not marking government-owned equipment or if you do not have access to the SF 902 or SF 903, the security markings can be applied with a permanent marker.</div>
