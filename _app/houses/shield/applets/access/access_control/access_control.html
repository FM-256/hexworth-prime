		<div>Introduction</div>
		<div>Access control is the process, procedures, systems and technologies used to ensure that only authorized users and systems gain the right to use an organization’s data systems, resources and information. These same safeguards prevent unauthorized users and systems from gaining access.</div>

		<div>A user identifies himself through a username which can be an employee ID, account number, email address name or other unique identifier.</div>
		<div>Multi-Factor Authentication</div>
		<div>The most popular form of authentication is the use of a password, passphrase, or PIN (something you know). You can also authenticate by using something you have, such as a token or key fob or by something you are like a fingerprint, retinol scan or face recognition.

Sometimes a user may be required to provide more than one form of authentication which is known as a multi-factor authentication.</div>
		<div>+</div>
		<div>Authorization assigns privileges to a subject. These privileges determine which objects the subject can access and the permissions that control the subject’s actions. Permissions include read, write, and delete.</div>
		<div>Accountability tracks the actions performed by a subject. Examples of accountability include event or transaction logs.</div>
		<div>Access Control
Framework
</div>
		<div>An access control model is a framework that refers to security features used to prevent unauthorized access to objects. These access control systems provide each of the essential services: identification, authentication, authorization, and accountability. Each model uses a different method to control how subjects access objects.
Click each model above for more information.

		<div>Rule-based access control uses criteria or rules defined by the custodian or system administrator. If an organization wants to limit access during certain hours of the day, make sure employees are using in-house systems, or to perform a specific transaction, rule-based access control fits the bill. Rules are typically sequential. Once a condition is checked, the permission is granted or denied.

		<div>The Biba Model describes a set of access control rules designed to ensure data integrity. Data and subjects are grouped into ordered levels of integrity. A subject cannot corrupt data in a level ranked higher than the subject’s permissions and restricts corruption of data at a lower level than the subject. Simple Integrity Axiom: “No read down”; a subject at a specific clearance level cannot read data at a lower classification. This prevents subjects from accessing information at a lower integrity level. This protects integrity by preventing bad information from moving up from lower integrity levels.

•* Integrity Axiom: “No write up”; a subject at a specific clearance level cannot write data to a higher classification. This prevents subjects from passing information up to a higher integrity level than they have clearance to change. This protects integrity by preventing bad information from moving up to higher integrity levels.</div>
		<div>Unclassified</div>
		<div>Top-Secret</div>
		<div>Different implementations of MAC are used for different purposes. The Bell–LaPadula model focuses on data confidentiality and controlled access to classified information. This model manages who gets read and write permissions to classified data. It is characterized by the phrase "write up, read down" (WURD). The Simple Security Property states that a subject at a given security level may not read an object at a higher security level.

The * (star) Property states that a subject at a given security level may not write to any object at a lower security level because this would reveal information at a greater security level to subjects with lower permissions. Unclassified, confidential and secret information could be written to top secret objects. However, top secret information cannot be shared or written to objects of lesser labels.</div>
		<div>Secret</div>
		<div>Confidential</div>
		<div>Focuses on Data Integrity</div>
		<div>Close</div>
		<div>Focuses on Data Confidentiality</div>
		<div>MAC is the strictest type of control. It takes a hierarchical approach to controlling access to objects. Subjects are assigned a clearance level and objects get assigned a
label.  A subject can access an object only if the subject’s clearance is equal to or greater than the object’s label.

In the MAC model, permissions are only valid for objects that a subject requires to perform the assigned task. A top-secret subject does not get unfettered access to all top-secret objects.</div>

		<div>Click each administrator for more information.</div>
		<div>DAC</div>
		<div>DAC restricts access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. In the strictest interpretation, each object controlled under DAC must have an owner who controls the permissions that allow access to the object. Although many modern operating systems support the concept of an owner, this is not always implemented. The model does not define “owners” leaving a problematic definition when group ownership occurs.</div>
