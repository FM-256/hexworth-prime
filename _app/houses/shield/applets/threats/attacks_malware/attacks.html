		<div>Malware (malicious code) is software that has been created for malicious or nefarious purposes. Malicious code can be installed in many devious ways that can be easy to miss by authorized users.</div>

		<div>Bots & Botnets</div>
		<div>Adware</div>
		<div>Viruses are malicious pieces of code that attach themselves to a piece of executable code or host application. It executes when the host application is executed. It replicates itself by finding other applications to infect. The virus, also, delivers its payload which can damage and delete files, rebooting issues, etc.</div>
		<div>Worms are malicious pieces of code that attack the network and computer systems. It doesn’t need assistance to self-replicate or travel through a network.</div>
		<div>Download Now</div>
		<div>Trojans are a deceptive piece of software that hide their malicious intent. Trojans can be disguised as games or special utility to entice the authorized user to copy and install it onto the system. Once they are on the system, the Trojan accomplishes its hidden purpose. The authorized user throughout remains unaware of the true purpose.</div>
		<div>Trojans are named after the horse from the Trojan War. In the war, the Achaeans wanted to takeover the city of Troy, however, they couldn’t crush they city’s defenses for years. Thus, they built a wooden horse to gift the people of Troy to deceive them. Allowing the soldiers to open the city gates and takeover the entire city in a day.</div>
		<div>Remote Access Trojans (RATs) are malware that allow control of a user’s computer from a remote location. RATs are usually attached to files that appear legitimate (phishing emails). After installation, the attacker is free to access the compromised computer whenever.</div>
		<div>Remote Access Trojan
(RAT)</div>
		<div>Logic bombs is malicious software or a code that remains dormant until an event causes it to release its payload. They are intentionally installed by, usually, an authorized user.</div>
		<div>An attempt to capture and store the user’s keystroke during a session. The captured keystrokes are then stored onto a file for later access by the attacker.</div>
		<div>Spyware is software that monitors or spies on user’s activity without their knowledge. It is installed without the user’s knowledge or consent. Spyware can record keystrokes, steal information, etc.</div>
		<div>sneakers</div>
		<div>Adware is a type of malware that shows unwanted advertisements to user in the form of pop-ups.</div>
		<div>SEARCH</div>
		<div>Bots comes from “robot” are software applications or computer program used to execute tasks automatically. Malicious bots allow an an attacker of remote takeover of a user’s system.

Botnets are many inter-connected computer or devices that contain multiple running malicious bots.</div>
		<div>A Rootkit is a collection of software programs that provide administrative access to a user’s system while hiding its presence on the user’s system.</div>
		<div>APT attacks hope to remain on computer systems for long period of time undetected. These attacks require sophisticated hacking techniques, time, and effort. They are usually carried out by a group of hackers that are highly organized and well-resourced. Hackers mostly target nation-states and corporations to gain intelligence on them. They create backdoors on the system to return in future. Example the DNC Email Hack (2016) The attack pattern:Develop a strategy: what is it they want to achieveGain entry into the systemAfter entry, for hackers to maintain an ongoing presence they create backdoors or rewrite code to remain undetectedExplore the network and gain administrator privilegeStage attack to accomplish goal and maintain ongoing presence</div>
		<div>Advanced Persistent
Threats (APTs)</div>
		<div>Zero Day Attacks</div>

		<div>Zero Day Attacks is an unknown flaw in either the hardware or software of a system that leaves the system vulnerable to a cyberattack.</div>
