The post does not provide any 
further information to identify Karl.
</div>
		<div>There are five clues containing useful OSINT in this post.  Click on the  different elements to see if you can find all five.</div>
		<div>Bezos is the nickname of the account
Owner, and that can be used as a 
potential password.

his wife’s birth year which is a popular password component.

</div>
		<div>Missy is a hashtag reference for either
his wife’s name or even a nickname. 
Another potential password.

		<div>Looking over someone’s shoulder and visually capturing logins or passwords (or other sensitive information) while they are using a computer</div>
		<div>Shoulder surfing can occur at close range (by looking over another’s shoulder) or from a longer range with something as simple as a pair of binoculars. Shoulder surfing does not require any techical skill, just keen 
observation skills. 

In a crowded place, shoulder surfing is easier since you are not as easily observed.

		<div>Dumpster diving means searching through trash for useful information. Think of all the things that you throw out that may contain either personal or corporate information. You can learn a lot about a person or company from the trash that they throw away, and most dumpsters are in publicly accessible areas. When was the last time you saw a locked dumpster?

Use this technique to retrieve seemingly innocent information like phone lists, organizational charts or employee information.

OSINT
</div>

		<div>Spokeo</div>
		<div>Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (overt and publicly available sources) to produce actionable intelligence. OSINT is primarily used in national security, law enforcement, and business intelligence functions. Alternatively, threat actors can use OSINT to harvest information about potential targets. The victim’s data can then be used for many types of attacks including password guessing, phishing, or even reconnaissance for a bigger attack.

		<div></div>
		<div>Click Next to go to the outer ring
</div>
		<div>Click on each inner ring icon
</div>
		<div>The inner ring is comprised of tools that you can use to gather information. Of course the Internet is an obvious source for open-source intelligence. Social media websites and user-created content such as cell phone videos are easy to access and provide useful information. There are also non-technical sources for information. Remember, one person's trash may be another person's treasure.</div>

		<div>Social media intelligence (SOCMINT) is a sub-branch of Open-source Intelligence (OSINT), and it refers to the information collected from social media websites. The data available on these sites can be either open to the public (like public posts on Facebook or LinkedIn) or private. Private information such as contents shared with a friend's circle, cannot be accessed without proper permission from the creator. Read the post from a social media website. Click on each button to discover the information revealed in the posted picture.

		<div>Web Pages</div>
		<div>Click on each of the highlighted buttons</div>
		<div>The most common function of OSINT is to map public facing assets and discover the information that each of the assets possesses. The information is used to discover and develop a potential attack surface.
</div>
		<div>Dates
</div>
		<div>Camera
</div>
		<div>Location
</div>
		<div>Metadata</div>
		<div>Metadata describes other data. It provides information about a certain item's content. For example, an image may include metadata that describes how large the picture is, the color depth, the image resolution, when the image was created, and other data. A text document's metadata may contain information about how long the document is, who the author is, when the document was written, and a short summary of the document.</div>
		<div>Click on each button</div>
		<div>Picture Owner
</div>
		<div>Setup Information
</div>
		<div>Using the location information obtained from the metadata, we can enter the values and obtain an address.</div>

		<div>Google Earth</div>
		<div>Google Earch renders a 3D or 2D representation of Earth based on satellite images, aerial photographs, and GIS
data. It allows users to visit places virtually giving them an invaluable tool to perform surveillance on the target from a simple map, visual recognition, and computation of distances from other objects in the immediate vicinity.

Street in London

		<div>Spokeo is a tool that can search by name, phone, address, or email to confidentially look up information about people you know such as friends, family, acquaintances, old classmates, and even yourself.
</div>
		<div>Spokeo</div>
		<div>We can find out who holds executive positions
within the organization and who the members
of the Board of Directors are. Now we have 
names and position titles.
</div>
		<div>Phone numbers, email addresses, store hours, and names all provide information for a possible attack vector.


</div>
		<div>Locations allow the use of such tools as Google Earth to conduct virtual reconnaissance. Store hour listings pinpoint times when the location might be more vulnerable.

		<div>Nslookup</div>
		<div>c:\>
</div>
		<div>Nslookup is a network administration command-line tool for querying the Domain Name System to obtain the mapping between a domain name and IP address or other DNS record.
</div>
		<div>c:\>nslookup

		<div>Shodan is a search engine that lets users search for various types of servers (webcam, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the Internet using a variety of filters.
</div>
		<div>Shodan</div>
		<div>Whois is a widely used Internet record listing that identifies who owns a domain and how to get in contact with him or her. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) regulates domain name registration and ownership.
